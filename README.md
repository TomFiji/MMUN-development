## Description
Hear Me Now. Server and Front end code.

Montessori Model UN is a leading producer of international Model UN programs. We are accredited with Special Consultative Status by the United Nations Economic and Social Counsel. We have developed a project for a website and FREE downloadable app that will help enhance the voice of youth in boardrooms and the halls of government. This exciting global project will launch at an event in the United Nations, and the development tram will be invited to attend. The project is HEAR ME NOW! and the FREE app will be available to two age groups: 9-17 and 18-24. We anticipate 2mm active users the first year with significant growth thereafter.
